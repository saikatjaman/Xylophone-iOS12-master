# Music App-iOS12-master
This is an app that will give you cool musices. Let's play on your own device.

# Our Goal
The goal of this project is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sounds and use AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great application developer is being able to solve the problems and find out how to use existing tools by reading the documentation.

# What you will create
You will be making a musical instrument! Musical apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. I am going to make a colourful XyloPhone app.

# What you will learn
* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* How to use tags in Interface Builder.
* Error handling using try and catch.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging for array index out of range errors.
