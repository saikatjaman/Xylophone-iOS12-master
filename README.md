# Xylophone-iOS12-master
This is an app that will give you cool musices. Let's play on your own device.

# Our Goal
The goal of this project is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sounds and use AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great application developer is being able to solve the problems and find out how to use existing tools by reading the documentation.

# What you will create
You will be making your first musical instrument! Musical apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. Weâ€™re going to make a colourful XyloPhone app. Get it? Ok, the jokes are bad, but remember, I only wrote the good ones ...
